# Lands
Lands is a sandbox game where you can create your own worlds.<br>Put thousands of species of plants and creatures to make your world come to life.

On August 7, 2018, the Lands repository was made. However, I had no idea on what to make, so I left it empty for 3 years.<br>
However recently, I've been thinking of finally doing something. No promises though.
